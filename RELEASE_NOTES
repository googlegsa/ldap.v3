Release 2.8.4, Jan 03, 2012
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is a preview maintenance release that improves quality without
adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes
------------------

  * Fixed issue 5560499: LDAP Connector appears to have 3 min 
    connection timeout. The fix provides the configurable timeout
    in connectorType.xml. This timeout is used for connector 
    configuration time. During traversal time, the default network 
    time out will be used.

  * Fixed issue 5699866: On LDAP Connector page de-selecting dn 
    attribute de-selects some other attribute.

  * Fixed issue 3096443: If no properties are selected in LDAP Connector
    configuration, connector instance can't be saved. Fix provides
    dn attribute as selected by default in the configuration form.

  * Fixed issue 3096456: Empty base dn value blanks out all the fields.
    Now the based dn field is mandatory, and displays missing values error
    if no value is provided.

  * Fixed issue 5552961: In LDAP Connector, there is no way to de-select 
    attributes.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 2.8. Earlier versions of the Connector Manager will not work
correctly with this version of the connector.


Release 2.8.2, Oct 20, 2011
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is a preview maintenance release that improves quality without
adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Fixed issue 3266950: The connector only saved up to 100 selected
    attributes and only from the first 100 listed on the configuration
    form would be saved. Selected attributes beyond the first 100
    shown on the configuration form would be ignored. All selected
    attributes are now saved and indexed. Manual edits to the
    connector properties file to workaround this issue will be
    preserved in the upgrade.
    
  * Fixed issue 4150942: Feeds stopped when the LDAP server was
    unavailable and did not resume until the connector was restarted.
    The connector now pauses after this error and retries until the
    LDAP server is available.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 2.6.0 and 2.6.4 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 2.8. Earlier versions of the Connector Manager will not work
correctly with this version of the connector.
