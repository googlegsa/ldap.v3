Release 3.2.10, March 20, 2015
==============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without
adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
encouraged to upgrade.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.8
------------------------
19613613 - LDAP errors that stopped the monitor thread logged only a
           generic "UNKNOWN_CONNECTION_ERROR" message.

19613118 - Some LDAP errors could stop the monitor thread and prevent
           further indexing of updates and deletes. The error was only
           logged to the Tomcat stderr log (catalina.out on Linux),
           rather than the connector logs.

19044850 - LDAP connector sends delete feeds after connection refused
           with LDAP server.
