Release 2.8.2, Oct 20, 2011
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is a preview maintenance release that improves quality without
adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Fixed issue 3266950: The connector only saved up to 100 selected
    attributes and only from the first 100 listed on the configuration
    form would be saved. Selected attributes beyond the first 100
    shown on the configuration form would be ignored. All selected
    attributes are now saved and indexed. Manual edits to the
    connector properties file to workaround this issue will be
    preserved in the upgrade.
  * Fixed issue 4150942: Feeds stopped when the LDAP server was
    unavailable and did not resume until the connector was restarted.
    The connector now pauses after this error and retries until the
    LDAP server is available.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 2.6.0 and 2.6.4 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 2.8. Earlier versions of the Connector Manager will not work
